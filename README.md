## My Personal Comments

I am entirely new to coding and required the assistance of a coding friend to achieve the results of this assignment.  I am aware that it does not completely meet the requirements set out though this result is a reflection that I am not yet at the level the assignments requires of me.  

I will be submitting within the realm of what I am capable of from hereon in, anything else would be a dishonest submission.
